A collection of Metatrader 4 ["MT4"] and R scripts

## About FX-Git

This project was created by me because projects created by either Software Geeks or Financial Gurus are mutually exclusive.

As both a Software Geek and Financial Guru, I mixed them up by writing codes about finance related stuff.

---

## About Me

**Software Geek**

Started as a hobbyist, studied computer engineering as a degree, then worked as a full-time software engineer, and a freelance programmer.

**Accounting / Financial Perfectionist**

Studied accounting as a master degree, worked as a research analyst & fund manager, and a cashflow accounting perfectionist.

**Trading Maestro**

Started as a hobbyist, and maintains an open-source repository of trading indicators and advisors.

**Passionate Learner**

Dabbled in email marketing, and new to full-stack development.

---

## What To Do Next

This collection has grown relatively large over time, and some of these scripts are course related.

Eventually, I will be moving some of these course related scripts to separate GitHub repositories.

The core scripts will remain in this repository.

---

## Prerequisites

This collection of scripts was written using either MT4 or R.

- Metatrader 4 ["MT4"] client and demo account with any broker.

- R and RStudio
